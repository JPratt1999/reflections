When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you wanted to publish your work anyway.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Same thing with commits, it only makes sense to have a logical cut on the changes 
    you make rather then let your computer decide.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are made to copy a repository that you are actually not allowed to 
    change anything on and is still lacated on GitHub.
    You clone to get repositories from GitHub on to your computer.
    Branches are only made locally.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can edit it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Easier: Just E-Mail the changes to the person and they except or not. Then I
    make the changes by myself.
    Harder: Use the command line and the editor from Windows.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you are starting a new project and you are not shure if its going to work or not.
    If you are making changes directly on master you won't have any problems with merge conflicts.
